| OntoCovidGroup_data_example.owl  |Fig. 1.  Fig. 3.  Fig. 5  (a, b, c, d) Fig. 6 (a, b)  |  This file contains the developed ontology to represent and analyze information about groups of people infected with Covid-19. This ontology can be opened with the tool Protégé. In Protégé is possible to see the components of the ontology (classes, properties, restrictions and instances) that were explained in the paper. In addition, this version of the ontology was populated with the examples used to evaluate it. Specifically the examples depicted in Figs 3, 4, 5 and 6. |
| OntoCovidGroup_real_data.owl  | Fig. 6 (a, b)  | This files contains the same developed ontology but populated with real data about patients stored in a public dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset).  In this ontology, the information about 5000 patients was represented. We used this data to show the capacity of the ontology to represent and analyze real data. This data can be consulted in the Covid-Data.xlsx file.|
| Covid-Data.xlsx	  |   |This files contains data about 5000 patients, a sample of the real data stored in the public dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset). This data was used to populate the version of the ontology presented in the file OntoCovidGroup_real_data.owl |
